## 💼 Academic and Research Projects
Currently, I’m working on my PhD in **Artifical Intelligence in Music**, and you’ll find some of my research-related projects here on GitHub. Here’s a snapshot:

- **[Automatic classification of chain of guitar effects](https://github.com/michelerossi1/Paper_effects_chain)** - Using genetic algorithms to automatically find DL models to classify chains of guitar effects.
- **[Dataset augmentation for music emotion recognition](https://github.com/michelerossi1/listening_test_webAPP)** - This repo refers to the web app that I have developed to  investigate the effect of data augmentation on the perceived emotion


### 🎚️ Music Production (Mixing & Mastering)
I also work as a producer, specializing in mixing and mastering for other artists. My main goal is to take budget-friendly audio recordings and elevate them to a professional sound quality:
